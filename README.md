A property management company manages individual properties they will build to rent, and charges them a management fee as the percentages of the monthly rental amount. The properties cannot overlap each other, and each property must be within the limits of the management companyâ€™s plot.  Write an application that lets the user create a management company and add the properties managed by the company to its list. Assume the maximum number of properties handled by the company is 5.
